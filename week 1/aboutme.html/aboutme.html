<h1>About Me</h1>

<body>
    <p>
        Hello to all reading this. My name is Lisa, and I am a second year MLIS student (that is, Masters of Library and Information Science).
        My specializations are Archival Science and Academic Librarianship. As an undergraduate student, I also went to UCLA and majored in History with a minor in Film, TV, and Digital Media.
        Because of some great internships I had as an undergraduate at the Fox Studios Archive (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/disney-fox-merger-and-future-hollywood/585481/" target="_blank">RIP</a>) and the Center for the Study of Political Graphics (<a href="https://www.politicalgraphics.org/" target="_blank">CSPG</a>), I began to see how I could apply my boundless interest in History.
        Archival science and archives themselves focus on preserving the history of a community and making it accessible to that community.
        When I first entered the MLIS program, my sole interest was archives. However, after having worked at Powell for a year doing research and reference work and having been a TA for a History class, my interest in working in an academic library as an instructional librarian has caught up to my interest in pursuing archival work.
        It's a <i>conundrum</i>, considering I graduate in about 2 months... But I'd be happy going in either direction, so I'm trying not to stress (famous last words)!
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides my career interests, things that make me happy include:
        <ul>
            <li><u>Camping, Hiking & Backpacking</u> --  A dream goal is to visit all national parks all over the country. I grew up in a rural area north of LA, and even though I love living in LA, I miss the quiet, the stars, the clean air, and the abundance of wilderness</li>
            <li><u>Painting and Sketching</u> -- Except oil paint, I do NOT have the patience that oil painting requires</li>
            <li><u>Big dogs, including horses</u></li>
            <li><u>Thematic cookbooks</u> -- especially the old ones, even though I'm not really a fan of cooking</li>
            <li><u>Binging TV & Movies</u> -- (anyone wanna talk about Falcon and the Winter Soldier? anyone <b>NOT</b> wanna talk about WW1984?)</li>
            <li><u>Working at Trader Joe's</u> -- If my whole ~work in a library or archive~ thing doesn't pan out, I'd be cool with staying at Trader Joe's</li> 
        </ul>
    </p>

<h2>Goals for this Course</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>I have been really interested in becoming more technologically literate for the past several years, but I was always too intimidated to take a class, and when I tried teaching myself, I'd get stuck and quit. Tragic.</li>
            <li>It sounds trite to say, but I just care a lot about a lot of global issues. I feel overwhelmed and cynical about the future, and being able to channel that frustration into productive projects is helpful to me, and hopefully others </li>
            <li>I also recently got into maps.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I helped host an event Fall Quarter featuring LA Public Library's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnSnmRvFIUg" target="_blank">Map Librarian</a>, and he was one of the coolest people ever to talk to.</li>
                    <li>Around the same time, the class I was TA'ing for had an assignment that required the students to use Stanford's <a href="https://www.davidrumsey.com/view/georeferenced-maps" target="_blank">David Rumsey Map Collection</a>, and it was one of the most mindblowing adaptations of primary source materials to publicly available online content I've ever seen.</li>
                    <li>And now I'm really into maps. (So a goal is to help me become more acquainted with how historical maps can be used with modern pedagogical tools).</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

    Here's a picture of me in front of one of <a href="https://la.curbed.com/maps/los-angeles-victorian-architecture-styles-map" target="_break">LA's Victorian-era houses</a>. Sadly the photo doesn't show much of the house, but the neighborhood is gorgeous!

# The agenda of this site:
This site is an onine project that digitized the maps created by the Home Owners Loan Corporation in the 1930s. 
This project is now infamous for its practice of "redlining" that drastically and horrifically shaped the lives of POC in the US.
This website brings to life and democratizes that information, making it real to contemporary viewers as Google Maps.

# This website speaks to me because...
As a historian trained in archival science and librarianship, I am passionate about making historical primary sources easily accessible.
It's easy to ignore history when it is locked away in repositories accessible only to academic or wealthy elite, 
but when anyone can access it in a familiar and approachable way, it is much harder to ignore, thereby empowering the public affected by it.

# How does this website work?
The website is simple and straightforward. There is an introduction page, that educates the site visitor on HOLC and redlining history.
The website also provides a segmented bibliography of sorts for the original map images, sorting them alphabetically by state and city name.
I find this map highly effective for several reasons:
  1) The simple nature of the original maps (a color-coded legend of A through D grading) translates seamlessly to the web map.
  2) Although the map only covers major cities in the US, it does so in extremely finite detail. For example, I am able to see the exact street and neighborhood where I currently live, and how it was classified, just by zooming and clicking.
  3) As stated previously, the style and functions of this map mimics that of the now ubiquitous Google Map, thereby creating a user experience with little to no learning curve.
  4) It is overlaid over a modern map, so while you are able to see the historic digitzed maps in relevant areas, one can still peruse other parts of the country in detail. 

# What tech does the map use?
In addition to the digitized historical maps, it also works in conjunction with Leaflet, Mapbox, and OpenStreetMap.

# What would I change?
Honestly I find this website already quite fantastic, it lays out the historical sources as they are, and they speak for themselves, powerfully.
This might make the map too complicated, but I would be interested in seeing a toggle option that allows the viewer to see the same map quadrants but with contemporary census data
  such as current poverty levels and health data. If the researcher could toggle through various decades, that would be even better to illustrate the impact of systemic racism.

				These five sites were my favorites in a two week long roadtrip I took with a friend. This is one of the most memorable trips I have ever been on, not only because of the gorgeous locations, but also because we experienced a completely bonkers weather whiplash! We saw extreme heat, rain, snow, and hurricane level winds all within a few days of each other. I loved it.

				<i>The colorful regions on the map denote the traditional lands of indigenous groups. In my roadtrip I passed through Din√© Bik√©yah, Pueblos, N√∫u-agha-t âv â-p âÃ±  (Ute), Goshute, and Nuwuvi (Southern Pauite) traditional lands. Feel free to click on the regions to see its identifier, and for more information on more traditional lands, please see
